Nintendo Game Rating Website

Key Features and Concepts:

1. A star-rating system where the user can rate each Nintendo game and clicking on the stars updates the rating score (JavaScript)
2. Elements are responsive (i.e. Mobile- and Desktop-friendly)
3. Uses box-sizing so that the size of elements include padding and border size
4. Uses a background image and a color gradient to darken an image
5. Uses Flexbox to align elements
